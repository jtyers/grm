# grm - Git Repo Manager

`grm` is a simple tool that helps you manage the large numbers of Git repositories you have checked out on your machine. I wrote it because there were not any tools out there that helped me to:

* easily "go" to a repository, giving me the option to clone if not on my machine

* manage my repositories alongside other repositories, while keeping the two easily distinct

* using a sensible directory layout that mirrors the repository remote names, so I don't have to worry about collisions
